# rh-ai-engineer Skill Conventions

Shared conventions for all skills in the rh-ai-engineer agentic collection.

## Prerequisite Verification Protocol

Before executing any skill, verify MCP server availability:

1. **Check MCP Server Configuration** - Verify required servers exist in `.mcp.json`
2. **Check Environment Variables** - Verify required env vars are set (check presence only, NEVER expose values)
3. **Check Optional MCP Servers** - Note availability; skip optional features if unavailable (non-blocking)

**When prerequisites fail:**

1. Stop execution immediately
2. Report the specific missing prerequisite:
   ```
   Cannot execute [skill-name]: [specific prerequisite] is not available

   Setup Instructions:
   1. [Server-specific setup steps]
   2. Set required environment variables
   3. Restart Claude Code to reload MCP servers

   Documentation: [link to server docs]
   ```
3. Offer options: "setup" (help configure now) / "skip" (skip this skill) / "abort" (stop workflow)
4. WAIT for user decision -- never proceed automatically

**Common prerequisite: OpenShift MCP Server**

Most rh-ai-engineer skills use the `openshift` MCP server by default (some skills may treat it as optional). Always defer to each skill's **Dependencies/Prerequisites** section for whether `openshift` is required or optional:
- Source: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-mcp-server
- Required env var: `KUBECONFIG`
- Setup: Add to `.mcp.json`, set `KUBECONFIG`, restart Claude Code

## Common Prerequisites

All rh-ai-engineer skills share these baseline prerequisites. Individual skills reference this section instead of repeating them.

**Required Environment Variables**:
- `KUBECONFIG` - Path to Kubernetes configuration file with cluster access

**Required Cluster Setup**:
- OpenShift cluster with Red Hat OpenShift AI operator installed
- For model serving skills (`/model-deploy`, `/serving-runtime-config`, `/debug-inference`): KServe model serving platform configured, model serving enabled on the target namespace (label: `opendatahub.io/dashboard: "true"`)
- For NIM runtime: NVIDIA GPU Operator and Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator installed

## Human-in-the-Loop Requirements

All rh-ai-engineer skills that create or modify Kubernetes resources MUST:

1. **Display the resource manifest** (with credentials REDACTED) before creation
2. **Ask for explicit confirmation** -- "yes/no" or "yes/no/modify"
3. **WAIT for user response** -- never auto-execute
4. **On failure, present diagnostic options** -- never auto-delete or auto-retry

**Never:**
- Create resources without user reviewing the manifest
- Display actual credential values (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Skip confirmation for any resource creation
- Assume approval -- always wait for explicit user confirmation

**Why This Matters:**
- GPU resources are expensive and may have associated costs
- Deployments may affect other workloads competing for cluster resources
- Credentials grant access to external services (NGC, model registries)

## Security Conventions

- **Credentials**: Never display actual values; only report presence/absence
- **Secrets**: Use proper Kubernetes Secret types (`dockerconfigjson`, `Opaque`)
- **KUBECONFIG**: Path and contents never exposed in output
- **Namespace isolation**: All resources created in user-specified namespace only
- **RBAC**: Check for sufficient permissions before attempting resource creation
- **Credential lifecycle**: Advise users to rotate API keys periodically
